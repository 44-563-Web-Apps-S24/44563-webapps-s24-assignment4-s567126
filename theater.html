        <h6>THE PROPOSAL - ANTON CHEKOV</h6>
        <p>A drawing-room in CHUBUKOV'S house.</p>

           <p>[LOMOV enters, wearing a dress-jacket and white gloves. CHUBUKOV rises
            to meet him.]</p>
            
            <p><h6>CHUBUKOV</h6>. My dear fellow, whom do I see! Ivan Vassilevitch! I am
            extremely glad! </p>[Squeezes his hand]</p> Now this is a surprise, my
            darling... How are you?</p>
            
            <p><h6>LOMOV</h6>. Thank you. And how may you be getting on?</p>
            
            <p><h6>CHUBUKOV</h6>. We just get along somehow, my angel, to your prayers, and
            so on. Sit down, please do.... Now, you know, you shouldn't forget all
            about your neighbours, my darling. My dear fellow, why are you so formal
            in your get-up? Evening dress, gloves, and so on. Can you be going
            anywhere, my treasure?</p>
            
            <p><h6>LOMOV</h6>. No, I've come only to see you, honoured Stepan Stepanovitch.</p>
            
           <p><h6>CHUBUKOV</h6>. Then why are you in evening dress, my precious? As if you're
            paying a New Year's Eve visit!</p>
            
            <p><h6>LOMOV</h6>. Well, you see, it's like this.<p> [Takes his arm]</p> I've come to you,
            honoured Stepan Stepanovitch, to trouble you with a request. Not once or
            twice have I already had the privilege of applying to you for help, and
            you have always, so to speak... I must ask your pardon, I am getting
            excited. I shall drink some water, honoured Stepan Stepanovitch.
           <p>[Drinks.]</p></p>
            
            <p><h6>CHUBUKOV</h6>. <p>[Aside]</p> He's come to borrow money! Shan't give him any!
            [Aloud] What is it, my beauty?</p>
            
            <p><h6>LOMOV</h6>. You see, Honour Stepanitch... I beg pardon, Stepan Honouritch...
            I mean, I'm awfully excited, as you will please notice.... In short, you
            alone can help me, though I don't deserve it, of course... and haven't
            any right to count on your assistance....</p>
            
            <p><h6>CHUBUKOV</h6>. Oh, don't go round and round it, darling! Spit it out! Well?</p>
            
           <p><h6>LOMOV</h6>. One moment... this very minute. The fact is, I've come to ask the
            hand of your daughter, Natalya Stepanovna, in marriage.</p>
            
            <p><h6>CHUBUKOV</h6>. <p>[Joyfully]</p> By Jove! Ivan Vassilevitch! Say it again--I didn't
            hear it all!</p>
            
            <p><h6>LOMOV</h6>. I have the honour to ask...</p>
