        <h6>THE PROPOSAL - ANTON CHEKOV</h6>
        <p>A drawing-room in CHUBUKOV'S house.

            [LOMOV enters, wearing a dress-jacket and white gloves. CHUBUKOV rises
            to meet him.]
            
            CHUBUKOV. My dear fellow, whom do I see! Ivan Vassilevitch! I am
            extremely glad! [Squeezes his hand] Now this is a surprise, my
            darling... How are you?
            
            LOMOV. Thank you. And how may you be getting on?
            
            CHUBUKOV. We just get along somehow, my angel, to your prayers, and
            so on. Sit down, please do.... Now, you know, you shouldn't forget all
            about your neighbours, my darling. My dear fellow, why are you so formal
            in your get-up? Evening dress, gloves, and so on. Can you be going
            anywhere, my treasure?
            
            LOMOV. No, I've come only to see you, honoured Stepan Stepanovitch.
            
            CHUBUKOV. Then why are you in evening dress, my precious? As if you're
            paying a New Year's Eve visit!
            
            LOMOV. Well, you see, it's like this. [Takes his arm] I've come to you,
            honoured Stepan Stepanovitch, to trouble you with a request. Not once or
            twice have I already had the privilege of applying to you for help, and
            you have always, so to speak... I must ask your pardon, I am getting
            excited. I shall drink some water, honoured Stepan Stepanovitch.
            [Drinks.]
            
            CHUBUKOV. [Aside] He's come to borrow money! Shan't give him any!
            [Aloud] What is it, my beauty?
            
            LOMOV. You see, Honour Stepanitch... I beg pardon, Stepan Honouritch...
            I mean, I'm awfully excited, as you will please notice.... In short, you
            alone can help me, though I don't deserve it, of course... and haven't
            any right to count on your assistance....
            
            CHUBUKOV. Oh, don't go round and round it, darling! Spit it out! Well?
            
            LOMOV. One moment... this very minute. The fact is, I've come to ask the
            hand of your daughter, Natalya Stepanovna, in marriage.
            
            CHUBUKOV. [Joyfully] By Jove! Ivan Vassilevitch! Say it again--I didn't
            hear it all!
            
            LOMOV. I have the honour to ask...
            
            CHUBUKOV. [Interrupting] My dear fellow... I'm so glad, and so on....
            Yes, indeed, and all that sort of thing. [Embraces and kisses LOMOV]
            I've been hoping for it for a long time. It's been my continual desire.
            [Sheds a tear] And I've always loved you, my angel, as if you were my
            own son. May God give you both His help and His love and so on, and I
            did so much hope... What am I behaving in this idiotic way for? I'm off
            my balance with joy, absolutely off my balance! Oh, with all my soul...
            I'll go and call Natasha, and all that.
            
            LOMOV. [Greatly moved] Honoured Stepan Stepanovitch, do you think I may
            count on her consent?
            
            CHUBUKOV. Why, of course, my darling, and... as if she won't consent!
            She's in love; egad, she's like a love-sick cat, and so on.... Shan't be
            long! [Exit.]
            
            LOMOV. It's cold... I'm trembling all over, just as if I'd got an
            examination before me. The great thing is, I must have my mind made up.
            If I give myself time to think, to hesitate, to talk a lot, to look for
            an ideal, or for real love, then I'll never get married.... Brr!... It's
            cold! Natalya Stepanovna is an excellent housekeeper, not bad-looking,
            well-educated.... What more do I want? But I'm getting a noise in
            my ears from excitement. [Drinks] And it's impossible for me not to
            marry.... In the first place, I'm already 35--a critical age, so to
            speak. In the second place, I ought to lead a quiet and regular life....
            I suffer from palpitations, I'm excitable and always getting awfully
            upset.... At this very moment my lips are trembling, and there's a
            twitch in my right eyebrow.... But the very worst of all is the way
            I sleep. I no sooner get into bed and begin to go off when suddenly
            something in my left side--gives a pull, and I can feel it in my
            shoulder and head.... I jump up like a lunatic, walk about a bit, and
            lie down again, but as soon as I begin to get off to sleep there's
            another pull! And this may happen twenty times....
            
            [NATALYA STEPANOVNA comes in.]
            
            NATALYA STEPANOVNA. Well, there! It's you, and papa said, "Go; there's a
            merchant come for his goods." How do you do, Ivan Vassilevitch!
            
            LOMOV. How do you do, honoured Natalya Stepanovna?
            
            NATALYA STEPANOVNA. You must excuse my apron and négligé... we're
            shelling peas for drying. Why haven't you been here for such a long
            time? Sit down. [They seat themselves] Won't you have some lunch?
            
            LOMOV. No, thank you, I've had some already.
            
            NATALYA STEPANOVNA. Then smoke.... Here are the matches.... The weather
            is splendid now, but yesterday it was so wet that the workmen didn't
            do anything all day. How much hay have you stacked? Just think, I felt
            greedy and had a whole field cut, and now I'm not at all pleased about
            it because I'm afraid my hay may rot. I ought to have waited a bit. But
            what's this? Why, you're in evening dress! Well, I never! Are you going
            to a ball, or what?--though I must say you look better. Tell me, why are
            you got up like that?
            
            LOMOV. [Excited] You see, honoured Natalya Stepanovna... the fact is,
            I've made up my mind to ask you to hear me out.... Of course you'll be
            surprised and perhaps even angry, but a... [Aside] It's awfully cold!
            
            NATALYA STEPANOVNA. What's the matter? [Pause] Well?
            
            LOMOV. I shall try to be brief. You must know, honoured Natalya
            Stepanovna, that I have long, since my childhood, in fact, had the
            privilege of knowing your family. My late aunt and her husband, from
            whom, as you know, I inherited my land, always had the greatest respect
            for your father and your late mother. The Lomovs and the Chubukovs
            have always had the most friendly, and I might almost say the most
            affectionate, regard for each other. And, as you know, my land is a near
            neighbour of yours. You will remember that my Oxen Meadows touch your
            birchwoods.
            
            NATALYA STEPANOVNA. Excuse my interrupting you. You say, "my Oxen
            Meadows...." But are they yours?
            
            LOMOV. Yes, mine</p>
